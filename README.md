# Hello World Demo

## Overview
This simple web page displays a “Hello World!” message with two interactive controls:
- **Change Color** cycles the text through five preset colors.
- **Toggle Animation** starts or stops a continuous fade‑in/fade‑out animation on the text.
- The page background is set to the uploaded image, embedded as a base64 data URL.

## Setup
No setup is required.  
Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
2. Click **Change Color** to cycle the message through five colors.  
3. Click **Toggle Animation** to start the fade effect; click again to stop it.

## Round 2 Improvements
- Added a CSS fade‑in/fade‑out animation controlled by the **Toggle Animation** button.  
- Embedded the uploaded PNG as a background image using a data URL.  
- Maintained the original color‑cycling functionality for user interaction.
