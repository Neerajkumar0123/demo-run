# Hello World Demo

## Overview
A minimal web page that displays a “Hello World!” message.  
- The text color can be cycled through five different colors with the **Change Color** button.  
- A **Toggle Animation** button starts or stops a continuous fade‑in/fade‑out animation on the text.

The animation is implemented with CSS keyframes and is toggled by adding or removing a CSS class via JavaScript.

## Setup
No special setup is required.  
Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
2. Click **Change Color** to cycle the message through five colors.  
3. Click **Toggle Animation** to start the fade effect; click again to stop it.

## Round 2 Improvements
- Added a CSS fade‑in/fade‑out animation.
- Included a button to toggle the animation on and off.
- Kept the original color‑cycling functionality for user interactivity.
